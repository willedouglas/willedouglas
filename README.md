### Hi there!

My name is **Douglas Wille** from **Brazil** and I'm currently working as **Tech Lead** & **Senior Software Engineer** at [Friday Finance](https://fridayfinance.com/). 

I'm **passionate about building and scaling products** and I've been on the road since 2014.

During my professional career I had the opportunity to work in companies of various formats, applying the best development practices (TDD, continuous integration), code review, pair programming and software development methodologies (Scrum, RUP and XP).

Modalities such as B2B and B2C focusing on retail, human resources, supply chain management, health and accounting. I also went through traditional companies and startups.

I strongly believe in the synergy of teamwork and high performance self-reliant teams. I value building products that significantly impact people's lives, helping the places I become increasingly efficient in their work processes.
